- Create a(n easier) way to get only the non-inherited attributes of a type
- improve documentation
- improve use of correct Exceptions: i.e. don't throw RuntimeError anymore and try to use correct exceptions when receiving errors from server
- Go over all FIXME/TODO/XXX messages in code to see what to do about them
- Write automated tests?
- improve support for queries (e.g. allow interface such as the with_ATTR_NAME way of ActiveDCTM)
- Improve the guidance of Exception by not throwing string-exceptions where CMIS exceptions would work
