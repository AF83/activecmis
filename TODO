- Create a(n easier) way to get only the non-inherited attributes of a type
- improve use of correct Exceptions: i.e. don't throw RuntimeError anymore and try to use correct exceptions when receiving errors from server
- improve support for queries (e.g. allow interface such as the with_ATTR_NAME way of ActiveDCTM)
- Improve the guidance of Exception by not throwing string-exceptions where CMIS exceptions would work
- For downloading renditions/primary content: allow streaming (i.e. don't load everything in memory at once)
- For getting the content: it should not be necessary to pick a file, if no filename is given a temporary file should be created (e.g. in /tmp)
